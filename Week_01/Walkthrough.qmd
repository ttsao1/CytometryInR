# Walkthrough
## Installing packages
This section is for going over how to download packages and load them into the environment. Packages can be downloaded through CRAN, Bioconductor, or GitHub. 

For installing through CRAN: 
```{r}
install.packages("dplyr") #Downloads packages from CRAN and requires quotations 
library(dplyr) #Loads package into the environment and does not use quotations
sessionInfo() #Shows you what packes are loaded 
```

Remember that you can add a ? in front of functions to bring up help pages to better understand how to use them.
